LEGAL STARTING COMMANDS/WORDS

CREATE TABLE: for creating tables; need one for intersect? consult spec + group
	> table name
	> field data types 
		>> String
		>> Int
		>> Double
		>> Time
		>> Date
	> field names (col names)
	> define Primary Key?

INSERT: for adding records into a specified table
	> table name
	> fields of that table (requires the user to know beforehand?)
	> corresponding datatypes (how to sync)

UPDATE: for updating (a) specific field in a table
	> table name
	> row number
	> field to be changed
	> note: SQL uses the WHERE command to determine which row to update, but I think for the sake
	of our simple DB it'd be better if the UPDATE command was it's own standalone entity 
	(It should still use the where word?)

DELETE: for deleting (a) specific record into a specified table
	> table name
	> see note in UPDATE for WHERE clause

SELECT: showing records, this has several modifiers
	> columns
	> table name
	> modifiers
		>> WHERE: throw the whole string at the corresponding command
		>> ORDER BY: col name
		>> LIKE: pattern (String?)
